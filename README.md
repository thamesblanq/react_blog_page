**React blog app**
This is an app created with react and other dependencies like json-server for backend resource simulation, axios for api requests, easy-peasy for state management, useContext for state management etc.

Can't deploy this to the net because it's making use of json-server to serve all the blog resources.

**Uses**
This app can perform all CRUD operations and is fully optimized, if you want to use it you should run <npm i> & <npx json-server -p 3500 -w data/db.json> on the command line.
